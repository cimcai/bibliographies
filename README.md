- **[philosophy-seminar-1-computationalism.md](seminar/philosophy-seminar-1-computationalism.md)** — Bibliography for Philosophy Seminar 1: Computationalism

## General

The [`general/`](general/) folder contains focused bibliographies on consciousness, AI, and related topics:

- **[theories-of-consciousness.md](general/theories-of-consciousness.md)** — Major theories of consciousness (GNWT, HOT, IIT, RPT, PP)
