# Bibliographies

A curated collection of academic bibliographies focused on consciousness, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.

## Overview

This repository contains organized bibliographies covering key topics in consciousness research, AI architectures, and foundational theories in cognitive science. The bibliographies are maintained as markdown files for easy reading and reference.

## Citation Format

Citations follow APA style where applicable, with DOIs and links to sources included when available. Note that citation formatting may vary slightly between files to accommodate different source types (journal articles, books, preprints, etc.).
